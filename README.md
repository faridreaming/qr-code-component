## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Modern CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I practiced modern CSS nesting, which made my stylesheet cleaner and less repetitive.

```css
& > div {
  padding: 1.5rem 0.75rem;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 1rem;
  & > h1 {
    color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
    font-size: 1.25rem;
  }
  & > p {
    color: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
    font-size: 15px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Next, I want to focus on writing HTML that is semantic and CSS that is consistent.

### AI Collaboration

I used GitHub Copilot in VS Code to ask common questions and clarify concepts, not to generate code.
